# prime-number-search

A just-for-fun prime number search mechanism utilizing own crud math algorithms.
It operates on strings representing decimal numbers to allow finding numbers exceeding max safe integer value in JavaScript (9007199254740991).
 
Of course this is just theoretical, as in practice it would just take ages to do so :)

### Usage

Just run the main script with a single parameter indicating how many prime numbers should be found, for example:

```
node . 100
```
